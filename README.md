# **CheckFast - Android App built with Compose**

This is an Android App submission made to Google Developers Student Clubs - India Regional Team as a part of Kotlin and Compose Camp, organized in the month of September, 2022.

**Problem Statement:** Provide a useful app to students to quickly check out on things that matter them the most.

**Proposed Solution:**  Weâ€™ve built an app that supports the following features -
* Check college attendance and know how many classes to attend to stay over 75%
* Plan your next CGPA by getting to know how much you will have to score this semester
* Split food bills easily with your friends using our fast and simple tool
